Hi, I'm Wanru!
					
This is a portfolio of my projects in VMD105. I’m taking this class to learn how to use different tools to create digital media. One of my favorite hobbies is creating digital art and my main medium is through Procreate on the iPad. After this class, I've learned many skills, one of my favorite being creating vector art using pen tool! 

photoshop final project
					
For my final project, I chose to create a portrait of a corgi because I’ve been thinking about adoping a dog. I used a water color background and played with the opacity to make it look like there was watercolor over the image. I also added the bone frame and cartoons on the side for a fun touch!

illustrator final project

For the vector project, I drew my friend’s cat. She is always lounging around like this! I first hand drew the image on Procreate, then used it as a template for the vector drawing on Illustrator. I added a pixel backgorund of star bursts and a transformed text.

Animate final project

For the motion project, I animated my cat design from the vector project so that it was eating food. I found food images on Google, cut them out in Photoshop and created rotating motion animations of them flying into the cat’s mouth. I also added a lot of sound files to emphasize the animations.

print final project

For the InDesign project, I created a flip book portfolio. I chose the main color to be lilac, my favorite color, and I chose Helvetica Neue typeface for a simple and clean look.
